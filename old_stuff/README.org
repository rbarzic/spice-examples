Examples to demonstrate use of a few open-source Spice simulators and
related tools

* ngsice/simple_inverter 

A simple inverter simulation using ngspice 

* ngsice/simple_inverter_osu_soc 

An inverter from the OSU_SOC PDK together with a simulation "loop" 
where the voltage is decreased from 1.8v down to 0.5v


* ngspice/alterparam

A example of the usage of alterparam from the documentation

* pyspice/simple_inverter

 - .lib file
   - .MODEL NM NMOS LEVEL=8 => .MODEL NM NMOS (LEVEL=8)
   - Check source code for parameter position for complex voltage source

A simple example of a NGSPICE simulation controlled by PySpice (assuming ngspice is installed in the default location)


* pyspice/simple_inverter_shared


A simple example of a NGSPICE simulation controlled by PySpice using the ngspice shared library.
Location of the NgSpice library is controlled by an environment variable
